### 2022-2023

#### PandaDoc: senior Python @ platform

PandaDoc is the leading Docs and E-Signing solution for businesses and individuals.

In January 2022, I joined the DevExp team at PandaDoc. I took part in maintaining and improving the company's Python stack, including a microservice framework, Django support library, Protobuf tooling, Kafka Connect (Debezium) and Confluent Schema Registry integrations. I've been monitoring and supporting components under the team's responsibility, writing documentation and conducting demos.

CIAN is the #1 real estate classifieds site in Russia with 6,2M monthly visitors.

CIAN Quality team required strong Python presence to meet its product needs and that is why I joined. During my time at CIAN I decomposed, coded, pushed to production and supported a number of product features while constantly monitoring and incrementally bettering Python components under my responsibility. Due to extensive nature of the features, I managed to contribute to a number of CIAN components, including search, platform libraries, authorization and mobile apps. CIAN's data driven engineering practices and meticulous processes have been a great source of learning and growth.
